### About myself: 
Got high technical education in Surgut State University. Having started my career like a System administrator in "College of Russian culture" and was working there for 3 years.  Like a sysadmin I created web-site of the college with help Wordpress CMS and also in my tasks was included users consulting (it was about 50 pc users), repairing PC and making local web of the college. This web site works yet, but little bit different from what I did.(https://www.znamenskol.ru/).
After "College of Russian culture" I got position of QA Manual in one of the biggest russian IT companies SberTech. On this position I was testing SAP Human Resource. Throught half-year of working on this position I moved to QA Automation and already was making auto-tests with help CBTA component (specialize SAP component for writing autotests to frontend and backend)
Now I interested in Web Development because it provides big possibilities for professional growth.
For this moment I work in Bell Integrator. It is one of the biggest IT companies in Russia. I have position Java backend developer (middle) and working on project named Sberbank Business Online
